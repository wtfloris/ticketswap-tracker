# ticketswap-tracker
(WIP) Retrieves metrics from concerts on Ticketswap, to determine when people buy and sell tickets for concerts. By tracking over time I'd predict you'd see peaks of people selling right after sales start and the day before/day of the concert.

# Warning
For your own sanity: don't try to understand what I've written so far. A kitten dies every time you try to understand uncommented unfinished code.
